1. write a code to connect a python code to database
=> 
a) 
using "pyodbc" library
pip install pyodbc

import pyodbc
conn = pyodbc.connect("Driver={SQL Server Native Client 11.0};"
                      "Server=SURESH;"
                      "Database=SQL Tutorial;"
                      "Trusted_Connection=yes;")

cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM Employ')

for row in cursor:
    print('row = %r' % (row,))

b) 
#!/usr/bin/python
import MySQLdb

db = MySQLdb.connect(host="localhost",    # your host, usually localhost
                     user="john",         # your username
                     passwd="megajonhy",  # your password
                     db="jonhydb")        # name of the data base

# you must create a Cursor object. It will let
#  you execute all the queries you need
cur = db.cursor()

# Use all the SQL you like
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM YOUR_TABLE_NAME")

# print all the first cell of all the rows
for row in cur.fetchall():
    print row[0]

db.close()

2. write a code to retutn the max number of times a character gets repeted consicutively in a string
        ex---- string=aabbbccccddddd output=5
=>

3. given a dataset in xlsv perform these steps:
       1.remove dublicate rows
	=> 
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_excel('C:\Temp\data.xlsx')
print(data)

# DataFrame.drop_duplicates(subset=None, keep=’first’, inplace=False)
subset = [list of cols]
keep = first, last
inplace = T/F

data.drop_duplicates()
data.sort_values('Age',ascending=False)

       2.make a column full_name by using first_name and last_name
	=>
df['full_name']=df['First Name'] +' ' + df['Middle Name'] + ' ' + df['Last Name']

df['full_name'] = df[['First Name','Middle Name', 'Last Name']].apply(lambda x: ' '.join(x), axis=1)

# in case of split name

df['Full_Name'].str.split(expand=True)

df['Full_Name'].str.extract(r'(?P<First_Name>\w+) (?P<Last_Name>\w+)', expand=True)

       3. save it to another file name user
	=> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-save-file-with-file-name-from-user-using-python/

f = open("demofile2.txt", "a")
f.write("Now the file has more content!")
f.close()

#open and read the file after the appending:
f = open("demofile2.txt", "r")
print(f.read())

# To create a file
pathlib.Path(filepath).touch()

# copies source file to a new destination file
shutil.copyfile(src, dest)


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. write a sql query to return a table that will show all the elements that are getting repeted consecutively more than 3 times.
=> 

SELECT *, COUNT(*) as cnt
FROM emp
GROUP BY eid
HAVING cnt >= 3


WITH T AS
(
SELECT *, 
COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY eid ) as Cnt
FROM emp
)
SELECT ename
FROM T
WHERE Cnt >= 3

2.  2.write a sql query to (physics marks,chemistry mark,math mark)columns into rows.
=> https://www.plus2net.com/sql_tutorial/sql_sum-multiple.php

3. 1 more questions related to joins came in which tables were given and we had to apply join twice in the table.
=> SELF JOIN
